# Present and Ready: A Liveness Detection for Real Time Face Recognition Attendance
Present and Ready is a capstone project developed for the College of Computing Studies (CCS), a department that is part of Western Mindanao State University (WMSU). 

The "Present and Ready: A Liveness Detection for Real Time Face Recognition Attendance" aims to eliminate the traditional paper-based attendance system that will speed up the attendance process by 40%, deliver a reliable attendance record with an accuracy of 95% using the real time face recognition system with anti-spoofing protection and can detect 30-35 students per class sessions.
